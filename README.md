## Setup Instructions

### Pull and Run Docker Image

# Run the container (maps port 8081)
docker run --rm -it -p 8081:80 <your-dockerhub-username>/capctf:latest
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/CAPCTF.git
cd CAPCTF

You just need to **replace**:  
- `<your-github-username>` → your GitHub username  
- `<your-dockerhub-username>` → your Docker Hub username  
- `<Your Name>` → your name

I can also create a **shorter, Docker Hub-friendly version** of this README for the repository description page.  

Do you want me to do that?
